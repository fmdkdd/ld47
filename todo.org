Florent:
- [X] Adjust train positions after merging worms
- [X] Make train move with uniform speed regardless of sampling
- [X] Gameover when train overflows tracks
- [X] Color worm by danger
- [X] Check worm length when moving
- [X] unclosed RoundWorms instead of StraightWorms?
- [ ] BUG: Train on last segment may not crash and skip ahead
- [ ] SFX/MUSIC!!!
- [ ] Cleanup levels/focus on pacing
- [ ] Touch up index.html

Merwan:
- [X] End-of-level nodes
- [X] Collisions lead to game over
- [X] Orbit around loop nodes to nudge player
- [X] Ditch rendering wire: use same color for linked switch and door
- [X] BUG: node-surrounding check not robust
- [X] More colors!
- [X] Visually distinct exit nodes
- [ ] Exit nodes animation to win level?
- [X] "on/off" visual effects for nodes/doors
- [ ] Worms are powered on segment by segment on level enter

Open:
- [ ] Add reset button on worm death
- [ ] Death animation for losing train
- [ ] Screen shake doesn't restore camera to initial position??
- [ ] last level: rotated lock shouldn't glow until powered on

Polish:
- [ ] Embelish trains
- [X] Level transition
- [ ] To make connection easier, maybe allow connection beyond the
  connectionDistance?
- [ ] Small gap when rendering closed worms

Ideas:
- Speedup/slowdown areas
- Score by speed to finish level?
- Less punitive: lives/reduce size of train instead of gameover
- Sliding doors that shorten the worm length
- Tiles that emit inert worms?
- Tiles that emit new trains?
- Colored trains act as keys for loop nodes
- Loop nodes can require multiple keys/(same color/different colors)
- Slowdown effet on gameover (to understand cause of failure)
- [X] Can move obstacle instead of using doors
