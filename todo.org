Florent:
- [X] Adjust train positions after merging worms
- [X] Make train move with uniform speed regardless of sampling
- [X] Gameover when train overflows tracks
- [X] Color worm by danger
- [ ] Forbid crossing own worm (to avoid shortcut bug?)
- [X] Check worm length when moving
- [ ] SFX/MUSIC!!!

Merwan:
- [X] End-of-level nodes
- [X] Collisions lead to game over

Open:
- [ ] Speedup/slowdown areas

Polish:
- [ ] Level transition
- [ ] Slowdown effet on gameover (to understand cause of failure)
- [ ] To make connection easier, maybe allow connection beyond the
  connectionDistance?
- [ ] Small gap when rendering closed worms

Ideas:
- Score by speed to finish level?
- Less punitive: lives/reduce size of train instead of gameover
- Sliding doors that shorten the worm length
- Tiles that emit inert worms?
- Tiles that emit new trains?
- Colored trains act as keys for loop nodes
- Loop nodes can require multiple keys/(same color/different colors)
