Florent:
- [X] Adjust train positions after merging worms
- [X] Make train move with uniform speed regardless of sampling
- [X] Gameover when train overflows tracks
- [X] Color worm by danger
- [ ] Forbid crossing own worm (to avoid shortcut bug?)
- [ ] Check worm length when moving

Open:
- [ ] Speedup/slowdown areas

Polish:
- [ ] Slowdown effet on gameover (to understand cause of failure)
- [ ] To make connection easier, maybe allow connection beyond the
  connectionDistance?
- [ ] Small gap when rendering closed worms

Ideas:
- Score by speed to finish level?
- Less punitive: lives/reduce size of train instead of gameover
